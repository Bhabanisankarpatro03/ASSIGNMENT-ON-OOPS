    "**Five Key Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of \"objects.\" These objects have properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods). Here are the five key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation:**\n",
    "   - Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit, known as a class.\n",
    "   - This protects the internal state of an object from external interference, promoting data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inheritance:**\n",
    "   - Creating new classes (child classes or subclasses) based on existing classes (parent classes or superclasses).\n",
    "   - The child class inherits the attributes and methods of the parent class, allowing for code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Polymorphism:**\n",
    "   - The ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways.\n",
    "   - This can be achieved through method overriding (child class redefines a method from the parent class) or method overloading (multiple methods with the same name but different parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Abstraction:**\n",
    "   - Focusing on the essential features of an object while hiding the implementation details.\n",
    "   - This simplifies the design and use of objects, making them more manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Object:**\n",
    "   - The fundamental building block of OOP.\n",
    "   - It represents a real-world entity with its own state (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
    "   - Objects are instances of classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts work together to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code. By understanding and applying these principles, you can write efficient and effective object-oriented programs.\n"

    "**Explanation:**\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Polymorphic Function `print_area()`:**\n",
    "   - The `print_area()` function takes a `Shape` object as input.\n",
    "   - It calls the `area()` method on the passed object, which can be either a `Circle` or a `Rectangle`.\n",
    "   - The appropriate `area()` method is invoked based on the object's type, demonstrating polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Function Call:**\n",
    "   - We create instances of `Circle` and `Rectangle`.\n",
    "   - We pass these objects to the `print_area()` function.\n",
    "   - The function correctly calculates and prints the area for each shape, showcasing the power of polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how polymorphism allows us to write generic code that can work with objects of different types, as long as they share a common interface (in this case, the `area()` method).\n"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `D` inherits from both `B` and `C`, which both inherit from `A`. When we call `d.method()`, Python needs to determine which `method()` implementation to use: the one from `B` or the one from `C`.\n",

    "Python uses a specific algorithm called C3 linearization to resolve the Diamond Problem. It determines the order in which base classes are searched for methods. In the above example, the MRO of `D` is `(D, B, C, A, object)`. This means that Python will first look for the `method()` in `D`, then `B`, then `C`, and finally `A`.\n",
